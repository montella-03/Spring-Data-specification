## Spring Data Specifications
Spring Data Specifications is a powerful feature provided by the Spring Data framework that allows you to define complex
queries dynamically using a simplified and type-safe API.
It provides a way to express query criteria using a set of predefined
operations and logical operators, enabling you to build flexible and
dynamic queries without having to write SQL statements manually.

The main purpose of Spring Data Specifications is to abstract away the low-level
details of query construction and enable you to focus on defining the conditions and constraints
of your queries in a more expressive and readable manner. It promotes code reuse and helps maintain a
consistent and standardized approach to querying data.
